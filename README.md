# TurnBasedRPG_AnotherWorldAdventure

Changing to action strategy based RPG TowerDefense, town building/management game, 
mouse and keyboard controller, 
top-down camera, 
RTS styled, ex. League of Legends, with similar action scheme. 
AI will be ran by GOAP and Utility based functions for smarter and more intuitive ai. (WIP)
Players will have to defend and manage their town. Recruit & train NPC's for various tasks, not just for combat. 

Might have to lower the scope if it pushes too far in time.
